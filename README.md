# Team App

Team App is a basic React Native application created for practicing React Native development. This app allows users to manage groups, create new groups, and add players to teams within those groups.

## Screenshots


## Features

- **Groups**: View a list of all existing groups and create new groups.
- **New Group**: Create a new group using a form. After creating a group, you will be redirected to the Players page.
- **Players**: Add new players to two different teams (Team A and Team B) within a group. Prevents duplicate player names across teams and displays the number of players.

## Learning Objectives

Throughout this project, we focused on several key React Native concepts and techniques, including:

- Navigation Stack
- useCallback and useEffect with focus
- Componentization
- Passing data through navigation
- Defining routes
- Customizable theme implementation
- Customizable font families
